# Atlantic Hurricanes Analysis ‚Äì Excel Project

## üéØ What I Built
In this project from my justIT Data Skills Bootcamp, I worked with a dataset of major Atlantic hurricanes. The core task was to populate the "Max Wind Speed" column by using the `SWITCH` function to look up the correct speed based on the storm's category (1-5), referencing a key within the worksheet.

## üí° Key Things I Learnt
- **The `SWITCH` Function**: I learned how to use `SWITCH` as an efficient alternative to a nested `IF` statement for matching a value against a list of possibilities.
- **Absolute Cell Referencing**: This was the most important lesson. By using `$` signs (e.g., `$B$32`), I locked the formula's reference to the wind speed key. This ensured that when I dragged the formula down, it continued to look at the correct key instead of shifting downwards, which would have broken the calculation.
- **Data Integrity**: This task showed me how formulas can be used to complete missing data in a consistent and accurate way, which is a fundamental step before any analysis can be done.

#### Example Switch Formula

## üîç Formula Breakdown
This is an exact formula I used in the "Max Wind Speed" column:
`=SWITCH(D6,1,$B$32,2,$B$31,3,$B$30,4,$B$29,5,$B$28,"Unknown")`

-   `SWITCH(D6, ...)`: It checks the value in cell `D6` (the category number).
-   `1, $B$32`: If the category is `1`, it returns the value from cell `$B$32`.
-   `2, $B$31`: If the category is `2`, it returns the value from cell `$B$31`, and so on.
-   `"Unknown"`: If the category is not 1-5, it returns "Unknown".
-   The `$` symbols make the references to the key (e.g., `$B$32`) absolute, which is essential for the formula to work correctly when copied across multiple rows.

## üõ†Ô∏è Excel Skills Demonstrated
- `SWITCH` function for conditional logic and lookups
- Absolute vs. Relative Cell Referencing
- Populating data based on a worksheet key
- Basic formula-based data completion

## üöÄ How to Explore
1.  Download `Biggest Atlantic Hurricanes.xlsx`.
2.  Click on any cell in the "Max Wind Speed" column (Column E) to see the `SWITCH` formula in action.
3.  Observe how the formula references the key located in cells B28:B32 at the bottom of the sheet.

## üìÅ Project Files

## üéì Part of My Bootcamp Journey
This project was a practical exercise from Week 1 / Day 3 of my bootcamp, focusing on advanced Excel formulas.

## ü§î If I Had More Time
- The next logical step would be to use this now-complete dataset to perform a full analysis with Pivot Tables to find insights, such as which wind speed category has caused the most financial damage.
